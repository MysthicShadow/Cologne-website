            <h4>History</h4>
            <p>Essence Elegance was founded, owned by 8 college students from Immaculate Conception College Inc. of Balayan, Batangas. 
            They are committed to creating perfumes of unparalleled quality and complexity.
            The quest was driven by the desire to redefine premium perfumery and provide clients with an unmatched olfactory experience. 
            Fragrances are the heart of the perfume industry.
            Creating distinctive and high-quality scents requires collaborating with skilled perfumers or receiving perfumery instruction. 
            Experimentation with different scent notes and formulas is required to produce a distinctive product range that matches with the brand's personality.
            Providing outstanding customer service and encouraging feedback are critical for increasing brand loyalty. 
            Listening to client feedback and constantly enhancing products and services can lead to a strong, positive reputation in the industry.</p>
